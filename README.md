# bonsai-native

`bonsai-native` is an OCaml native UI experiment for sharing state and actions
across iOS, macOS, and Android while leaving rendering to each platform UI.

The app UI is authored in OCaml. Platform code is only the renderer bridge:

```text
OCaml graph component
  -> bonsai_native node tree
  -> platform renderer + event table
  -> Android JNI / Apple SwiftUI bridge
  -> Jetpack Compose / SwiftUI
  -> native app UI
```

This is not a WebView and not a SwiftUI wrapper.

## Packages

- `bonsai_native`: shared OCaml graph state runtime, node DSL, JSON/event bridge,
  and app driver.
- `bonsai_android`: Android facade over `bonsai_native`; rendered by Kotlin
  Compose through JNI.
- `bonsai_apple`: iOS/macOS-facing API and renderer abstractions; SwiftUI is the
  maintained Apple backend.

Backend package names intentionally remain explicit. Existing Android code can
continue to open `Bonsai_android`, and iOS code can continue to open
`Bonsai_apple`.

## OCaml UI Example

```ocaml
let component graph =
  let count, set_count = Bonsai_android.state graph ~key:"count" 0 in
  Bonsai_android.vstack
    [ Bonsai_android.text (string_of_int count)
    ; Bonsai_android.button "Increment" ~on_click:(set_count (count + 1))
    ]
```

On Android, Compose receives a native node tree JSON payload and sends event ids
back to OCaml through JNI. OCaml owns the graph driver and event table, so state
updates stay shared above the platform renderer.

## Repository Layout

- `native/`: shared `bonsai_native` implementation.
- `src/`: Android OCaml facade.
- `android/`: Gradle/Compose demo app.
- `android/examples/`: Android demo components, native entrypoint, and asset
  export helpers.
- `jni/`: Android JNI bridge into OCaml.
- `apple/`: Apple OCaml package, SwiftUI backend, and iOS/macOS examples.
- `web/demo/`: browser demo for the shared Android demo components.
- `scripts/`: Android and iOS bootstrap/build helpers.
- `docs/`: architecture and platform build notes.

## Android Quick Check

Use a switch with the Android cross compiler and Jane preview packages. The
current working path is documented in
[docs/android-native-build.md](docs/android-native-build.md).

```sh
export BONSAI_NATIVE_OPAM_SWITCH=/path/to/your/ocaml-android-switch

scripts/build-android-native.sh
cd android
rtk proxy ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

The debug APK should contain:

```text
lib/arm64-v8a/libbonsai_android_counter.so
```

Run the emulator smoke test:

```sh
scripts/test-android-emulator.sh
```

It installs the APK, launches the counter, taps `Increment`, and verifies the UI
changes from `0` to `1`. It also switches through the Android `Todo` and
`Search` tabs, which mirror the current iOS demo tabs.

## iOS Quick Check

The iOS package is under `apple/` and builds through opam-cross-ios contexts.
See [docs/apple-native-build.md](docs/apple-native-build.md).

The simulator app target is:

```sh
opam exec -- dune build apple/examples/BonsaiNativeDemos.app \
  --workspace dune-workspace.simulator
```

## Status

Working now:

- Shared OCaml DSL for text, button, text fields, stacks, scroll views, keyed
  lists, navigation stacks, images, custom views, and common modifiers.
- Android JNI native library built with OCaml 5.2.1 and the local graph runtime.
- Android Compose renderer loads real native OCaml state and dispatches clicks
  back into OCaml.
- Android and iOS demo apps expose the same `Counter`, `Todo`, and `Search`
  OCaml views.
- Apple source/backend scaffolding is included in the same repo.

Still early:

- Android release-size optimization.
- More complete iOS packaging automation.
- AppKit backend.
- Shared persistence/sync packages above the UI layer.
